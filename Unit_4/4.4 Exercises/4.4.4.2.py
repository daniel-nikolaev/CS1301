#Write a function called "load_file" that accepts one 
#parameter: a filename. The function should open the
#file and return the contents.#
#
# - If the contents of the file can be interpreted as
#   an integer, return the contents as an integer.
# - Otherwise, if the contents of the file can be
#   interpreted as a float, return the contents as a
#   float.
# - Otherwise, return the contents of the file as a
#   string.
#
#You may assume that the file has only one line.
#
#Hints:
#
# - Don't forget to close the file when you're done!
# - Remember, anything you read from a file is
#   initially interpreted as a string.


#Write your function here!
